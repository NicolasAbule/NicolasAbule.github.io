"Besides oseltamivir, what other treatment option showed potential in mitigating future pandemics according to the research in Hong Kong?","? [SEP] a number of reasons . 1 the pandemic virus came from a reassortment event in swine rather than birds , was a strain of h1n1 rather than a subtype that was not concurrently circulating in humans , and appeared to have a mild severity profile similar to seasonal influenza . furthermore , the pandemic emerged in north america , whereas most attention had been focused on the risk of a novel virus emerging in south - east asia . 2 , 3 hong kong , a subtropical city on the south coast of china , has been identified with influenza research for decades ; indeed , the 1968 pandemic influenza a ( h3n2 ) virus was named after the city after being first identified there in july 1968 . 4 hong kong has found itself on the front lines of recent emerging infectious disease outbreaks , including the first human outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza a ( h5n1 ) in 1997 , 5 and the severe acute respiratory syn - drome ( sars ) outbreak from 2002 - 2003 , which spread from southern china through hong kong to the rest of the world . following sars , the centre for health protection was established to take a leading role in the prevention and control of diseases in hong kong . in 2004 , the hong kong government created the research fund for the control of infectious diseases with an endowment of us $ 57 million , aiming to encourage , facilitate , and support research on the prevention , treatment , and control of infectious diseases . the population of hong kong have on one hand been sensitized to the risk of emerging infectious diseases through these experiences in the last 15 years , while hong kong ' s close connectivity to china and south - east asia has led to fears that it may be one of the first developed cities affected by a novel pathogen such as a new pandemic influenza strain that emerges in the region . 3 as a result , hong kong has invested heavily in infrastructure in preparation for future epidemics and pandemics . there has also been substantial investment in research infrastructure , essential to guide evidence - based policy locally as well as internationally . following the world health organization ( who ) global alert in april 2009 , hong kong health authorities initially operated under containment efforts , including entry screening at airports , ports and border crossings , hospital isolation of cases , tracing and quarantine of contacts , and routine antiviral prophylaxis . once the first local case [SEP]",0.38433075456526783
