        <p class="about">
            Hey there, as you can see above you I'm Nicolas Abule. 
            I'm first and foremost a programmer who is based in Toronto within the amazing country of Canada.
            My first foray into programming was in high school when I was trying to look into game development.
            I learned a hell of alot about the artistry of games through music, pixel art, story writing and design.
            But all of that was too much for me so I stuck to writing code through computer programming classes in high school.
            That all lead to me going to take computer science at Toronto Metropolitan univeristy which I am doing right now.

        <p class="about">
            Throughout my teens I have been obsessed with the creative doing of things.
            Whether it be the artistry of music or drawings or otherwise.
            In high school I took communications and woodworking which exposed me to the large amount of amazing things that I would never have seen otherwise.
            Seeing how to create beauty out of a simple image through photoshop or carving a block of wood into a beautiful sculpture were some highlights.
            A quote that tells my philosophy well is <span class="bold">"The life and simple beauty of it is simply too good too pass up"</span>
